# HawkEye-Lab-CyberDefenders
This repository contains my notes and analysis from the [HawkEye lab](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/hawkeye/) on [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/achievements/Niharika/hawkeye/). 
The lab focuses on **network traffic analysis** and **Blue Team operations** using **Wireshark**.

## Tools Used: `Wireshark`

## Scenario:
An accountant at your organization received an email regarding an invoice with a download link. Suspicious network traffic was observed shortly after opening the email. As a SOC analyst, investigate the network trace and analyze exfiltration attempts.

## Questions:


## Q1 : How many packets does the capture have?  
**Answer:** `4003`

## Q7 : The organization works with private addressing and netmask /24. How many computers are involved in the capture?  
**Answer:** `3`  

In Wireshark under Statistics > Endpoints, I observed 4 IP addresses. One of them was 10.4.10.255, which is the broadcast address for the /24 network and not an actual host. Excluding the broadcast address, there are 3 computers involved in the capture.

### What I Learned:
- Learned to **correlate ports and data size** to spot suspicious traffic.  
- Used **Wireshark conversations** to track abnormal data flow.  
- Understood how attackers use **legitimate protocols like SMTP (port 587)** for sending stolen information.  
- Improved my **analytical and investigation skills** in network forensics.  

This challenge enhanced my ability to think like an analyst combining **technical evidence** with **behavioral reasoning** to uncover hidden threats.
